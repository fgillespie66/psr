         How do I rush Phi Rho this semester (Fall 2020)?
        </div>

        <div class="Paragraph">
            This semester, the IFC (InterFraternity Council) has decided to postpone a formal bidding recruitment process until Spring 2021. This was decided so that every potential new member would have the opportunity to meet the Greek group in person before making an official commitment. However, instead of a formal rush, we will be hosting informal "recruitment" events so that potential new members can get to know us without any pressure of bids!

          How does rush work in a typical semester?
      </div>
        <div class="Paragraph">
          In a typical semester, Phi Rho (along with the rest of the IFC) will have a Rush Week. This week will have informal events to provide an opportunity for potential new members to meet the members of Phi Rho! In the past, we have had a boba and board games event, a Project Runway Marathon, a card making service event, a sundae event, a trip to Boston, and more! To rush Phi Rho, come to at least 2 of our events!.   </div>
